2025-03-19 11:06:45,470 - __main__ - ERROR - Initialization error: For many-to-one relationship UserNotificationPreference.user, delete-orphan cascade is normally configured only on the "one" side of a one-to-many relationship, and not on the "many" side of a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship.  To force this relationship to allow a particular "User" object to be referenced by only a single "UserNotificationPreference" object at a time via the UserNotificationPreference.user relationship, which would allow delete-orphan cascade to take place in this direction, set the single_parent=True flag.
